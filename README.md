# Rico Nasty Google Doodle
Maria Kelly, also known as Rico Nasty, is an American rapper, widely known for her eccentric style and cutting edge lyrics. Rico Nasty works closely with my favorite music producer, Kenny Beats. I knew of Rico through one of her earlier songs off her third mixtape titled Sugar Trap. I became a true stan after her appearance on Kenny Beats' YouTube Series, The Cave. Each episode of The Cave is 5-20 minutes long and features Kenny Beats, with different rappers working to create a unique beat and freestyle lyrics.
